            Hi README expert, I would like to create a README for my repository.
            It's a simple project named 'claude-prompt-catalog'.

            Here's the tree:
            .
            ├── LICENSE
            └── prompts
                ├── insight_extractor
                │   └── system.xml
                ├── prompt_generator
                │   ├── examples.xml
                │   ├── system.xml
                │   └── user_facing_prompts
                │       └── evaluate_insights.xml
                └── readme-writer
                    └── system.xml

            It contains system prompt and examples. No prog language.
            I share my prompts in this repo to help people.
