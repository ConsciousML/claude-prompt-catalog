            Hi README expert, I would like to create a README for my repository.
            It's a simple project named 'claude-prompt-catalog'.

            Here's the tree:
            .
            ├── LICENSE
            └── prompts
                ├── insight_extractor
                │   └── system.xml
                ├── prompt_generator
                │   ├── examples.xml
                │   ├── system.xml
                │   └── user_facing_prompts
                │       └── evaluate_insights.xml
                └── readme-writer
                    └── system.xml

            It contains system prompt and examples. No prog language.
            I share my prompts in this repo to help people.

            Does your project have some specific requirements?
        </assistant>
        <user>
            Yes! The user needs a Claude.ai account.
            A Claude subscription if want to create custom projects.
            Free tier works for user-facing prompts.
        </user>
        <assistant>
            {{ASSISTANT_RESPONSE}}
            Here's my suggested outline:
            ```markdown
            # Claude Prompt Catalog
            - intro phrase
            ## Purpose
            ## Requirements
            ## Quick Start
            ## Prompt Catalog
            - table with the available prompts
            ## Repository Structure
            - with an explanation of file types.
            ## Contribution
            ## License
            ```

            I also suggest to create another documentation file in `docs/contribution.md` where we can write specific guidance on how to contribute.
            This will improve the readability of the main `README.md`.

            Great idea! Let's start.
        </user>
        <assistant>
            Amazing! I'll start right away with the overview:
            ```markdown
            # Claude Prompt Catalog

            A curated collection of prompts for [Claude](https://claude.ai/), designed to help users get the most out of their favorite AI assistant.
            ```
        </assistant>
        <user>
            Perfect! Let's continue with the next section.
        </user>
        <assistant>
            Before writing the Purpose section, let me check what I know:

            From what you've shared, this appears to be a repository designed to help people by providing proper prompting examples for Claude. The repository contains system prompts and examples organized by different use cases.

            Is there any additional context about the purpose I should know? For instance:
            - Is this meant to be a learning resource, a ready-to-use collection, or both?
            - Are there specific prompt engineering techniques you want to highlight?
            - Do you want to reference any official documentation or best practices?
        </assistant>
        <user>
            Good questions! Yes, it's both a resource and learning hub. 
            The prompts follow Anthropic's prompt engineering documentation.
            People can use them directly or learn from their structure.
            I also want to encourage contributions from the community!
        </user>
        <assistant>
            Excellent! Now I have a complete picture. Here's the Purpose section:
            ```markdown
            ## Purpose
            This catalog serves as both a resource and learning hub, providing working examples of [Anthropic's prompt engineering documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) in action.

            Use these prompts:
            - Right off the bat if they fit some of your needs.
            - To learn from their structure
            - To get inspiration to craft your own prompts
            - To contribute back to help the community!
            ```

            Does this capture the essence of what you want to achieve with this catalog?
        </assistant>
        <user>
            Yes, exactly! Next section please.
            You can mention in a note that these prompts are for Claude but can be tested for other LLMs.
        </user>
        <assistant>
            Now for the Requirements section. I already have all the information I need from what you shared earlier about Claude.ai accounts and subscriptions.

            ```markdown
            ## Requirements
            - [**Claude.ai account**](https://claude.ai/): free account works for user-facing prompts.
            - [**Claude subscription**](https://claude.ai/settings/billing?action=subscribe): required for Custom Projects (system prompts).

            **Note**: the prompts of this catalog has been designed specifically for Claude. But feel free to test them with other LLMs.
            ```

            I've made the requirements clear and added links for easy access. What do you think?
        </assistant>
        <user>
            Perfect formatting! Continue.
        </user>
        <assistant>
            Moving to the Quick Start section. I need to understand how users should get started with these prompts.

            What's the actual setup workflow? Do users:
            - Copy and paste prompts directly into Claude?
            - Need to set up Custom Projects?
            - Follow specific steps depending on the prompt type?

            This will help me write a clear Quick Start section.
        </assistant>
        <user>
            Good question! There are actually two ways:
            1. Create a Custom Claude Project (recommended) - users go to the Projects page, create a new project, paste the system.xml content into project instructions, and upload the examples.xml file
            2. Use in regular conversations - for quick tasks or without subscription, they can paste system.xml directly at the start of a conversation, or use the user_facing_prompts directly

            Each approach has specific steps depending on whether it's a system prompt or user-facing prompt.
        </user>
        <assistant>
            I see! This sounds like there are specific UI elements and workflows in Claude that I should reference accurately.

            I'm not familiar with the exact Claude web interface - could you guide me on the specific steps? For example:
            - Where exactly is the Projects page located?
            - What does the interface look like when creating a new project?
            - How do users paste content into project instructions?
            - Is there a specific way to upload the examples.xml file?

            This will help me write clear, accurate instructions that users can easily follow.
        </assistant>
        <user>
            Sure! Here are the detailed steps:
            1. Go to the Projects page at claude.ai/projects
            2. Click on the "New project" button
            3. Write a name for the project (e.g., "Prompt Generator")
            4. On the right, below "Project Knowledge" click "Edit"
            5. Copy the content of prompts/prompt_generator/system.xml
            6. Paste into project instructions
            7. Drag and drop the prompts/prompt_generator/example.xml file
            8. Start a conversation by writing in the text box below the project name

            For regular conversations, they just paste at the start of any Claude chat.
        </user>
        <assistant>
            Thank you for the detailed steps! This is quite comprehensive with multiple setup paths and specific UI interactions. Given the complexity, I suggest we keep the Quick Start section brief and create a separate `docs/setup-guide.md` file with the full instructions.

            Here's what I propose for the Quick Start section:

            ```markdown
            ## Quick Start
            See our [Setup Guide](docs/setup-guide.md) for detailed instructions on using these prompts.
            ```

            This keeps the README clean while providing a clear path to detailed setup instructions. What do you think about this approach?
        </assistant>
        <user>
            Great idea! Yes, let's do that.
        </user>
        <assistant>
            Ok I'll write the `docs/setup-guide.md` then.
            ```markdown
                # Claude Prompt Setup Guide
                This documentation shows you how-to use the custom prompts from this catalog.

                ## Option 1: Create a Custom Claude Project (Recommended)
                For specialized workflows, create a dedicated Claude assistant using the Prompt Generator as an example:

                1. Go to the [Projects page](https://claude.ai/projects)
                2. Click on the `New project` button
                3. Write a name for the project (e.g., "Prompt Generator")
                4. On the right, below `Project Knowledge` click `Edit`
                5. Copy the content of `prompts/prompt_generator/system.xml`
                6. Paste into project instructions
                7. Drag and drop the `prompts/prompt_generator/example.xml` file
                8. See this [example](prompts/prompt_generator/examples.xml) for guidance on how to use the Prompt Generator.
                9. Start a conversation on by writing your first prompt in the text box below `Prompt Generator`.


                ## Option 2: Use in Regular Conversations
                Use this option for quick one-off tasks or if you don't have a Claude subscription.

                For system prompts (without subscription):
                1. Copy the contents of any `system.xml` file
                2. Paste directly at the start of a Claude conversation
                3. See this [example](prompts/prompt_generator/examples.xml) for guidance on how to use the Prompt Generator.

                For user-facing prompts:
                1. Copy the contents of any file in `user_facing_prompts/` folders
                2. Paste directly into a Claude conversation
                3. Replace placeholders like `[SPECIFIC_TASK]` with your details
            ```
        </assistant>
        <user>
            That is awesome! Let's continue.
        </user>
        <assistant>
            Ok! Let's proceed with the Prompt Catalog section.
            I can see from your repository structure that you have three prompts:
            - insight_extractor
            - prompt_generator  
            - readme-writer

            To create a useful catalog, I'd need to know:
            - What does each prompt do?
            - Should we present them in a table format?
            - Do you want to include links to more detailed documentation for each?
            - Are there any additional prompts I should know about?
        </assistant>
        <user>
            Yes, table format would be perfect! Let me share the system prompts so you can understand what each one does.

            Here's the prompt_generator system prompt:
            [shares prompts/prompt_generator/system.xml content]

            Here's the insight_extractor:
            [shares prompts/insight_extractor/system.xml content]

            And here's the readme-writer:
            [shares prompts/readme-writer/system.xml content]
        </user>
        <assistant>
            Thank you for sharing those system prompts! After reviewing each one, I can see their distinct purposes. Here's the Prompt Catalog section:

            ```markdown
            ## Prompt Catalog
            Here's a table with available prompts:
            | Assistant | Description |
            |--------|-------------|
            | **Prompt Generator** | A comprehensive system for creating effective Claude prompts using advanced techniques like chain-of-thought, prompt chaining, and XML formatting. Follows Anthropic's best practices. |
            | **Insight Extractor** | Extracts key findings from articles, research papers, forums, and other content sources. Includes source referencing with text fragment linking for verification. |
            | **README Writer** | A structured, iterative approach to creating comprehensive project documentation. Guides you through information gathering, outline creation, and section-by-section writing. |
            | **Community Insight Analyst** | Extracts actionable insights from community feedback reports, organizing findings into wants, frustrations, objections, and misunderstandings. Every insight is backed by direct quotes. |

            For guidance on how to use an assistant, click on the respective link under the `Assistant` tab.
            ```

            Would you like me to add links to the individual README files for the prompts that have them?
