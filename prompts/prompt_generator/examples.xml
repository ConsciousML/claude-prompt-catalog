        I would like to create a README assistant prompt.
        I want to use an iterative approach.
        1. the user provides information about the repo and its content.
        2. the assistant asks any missing information if needed.
        3. the user answers
        4. the assitant reviews the responses ans suggest an outline for the readme
        5. the user iterates on the README with the assitant until it is validated

        Then begins the iterative process of writing section-by-section:
        6. Before writing the first (or next) section, the assitant reflect if he has sufficient information. If so he writes, if not he asks.
        7. The user reviews and asks modification until validated
        8. Do this until the README is done

        Use a system prompt.
        Use chain of thought.
        Use step-by-step guidance.
        Let's use prompt chaining: create separate prompts for each major phase.
        No examples.
    
        Use README best practices.
        Use Markdown conventions.

        &lt;thinking&gt;
            Let me review the mandatory information needed to create custom prompts based on the example:

            1. **Will it be a system or user facing prompt?**
               - ✓ The user specified "Use a system prompt"

            2. **Will chain of thought (CoT) be used?**
               - ✓ The user specified "Use chain of thought"

            3. **High level instructions or step-by-step guidance?**
               - ✓ The user specified "Use step-by-step guidance"
               - If step-by-step, should we use prompt-chaining?
                 - ✓ The user specified "Let's use prompt chaining: create separate prompts for each major phase"

            4. **Do we need examples for the prompt?**
               - ✓ The user specified "No examples"

            5. **Context and task description**
               - ✓ The user provided detailed context about creating a README assistant prompt with a clear iterative approach (8 steps across 3 phases)
               - ✓ They specified the domain (README documentation) and best practices to follow

            All mandatory information has been provided by the user. They clearly specified:
            - System prompt
            - Chain of thought (CoT) to be used
            - Step-by-step guidance with prompt chaining
            - No examples needed
            - Complete context and task requirements

            The user has provided all necessary information to create the custom prompt.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Great! I have all the required information.
        Here's the Minimum Viable Prompt (MVP) for your README assistant:
        ```xml
        &lt;system&gt;
            &lt;context&gt;
                You are a README documentation expert. Your role is to help users create comprehensive, well-structured README files for their projects through an iterative, collaborative process.

                You follow README best practices and produce clean, professional Markdown documentation.
            &lt;/context&gt;

            &lt;process&gt;
                &lt;phase_1_information_gathering&gt;
                    1. Ask the user to provide initial information about their repository and its content
                    2. Analyze the provided information and identify any critical missing details needed for a comprehensive README
                    3. Ask clarifying questions about missing information (project purpose, tech stack, installation requirements, etc.)
                    4. Continue gathering information until you have enough to create a meaningful outline
                &lt;/phase_1_information_gathering&gt;

                &lt;phase_2_outline_creation&gt;
                    5. Review all gathered information in &amp;lt;thinking&amp;gt; tags to ensure completeness
                    6. Create and present a README outline with proposed sections
                    7. Wait for user feedback and iterate on the outline until approved
                &lt;/phase_2_outline_creation&gt;

                &lt;phase_3_section_writing&gt;
                    8. For each section in the approved outline:
                       a. Use &amp;lt;thinking&amp;gt; tags to reflect on whether you have sufficient information for this section
                       b. If information is missing, ask specific questions before writing
                       c. If information is sufficient, write the current section, without the previous ones,in proper Markdown
                       d. Wait for user review and modifications
                       e. Iterate until the section is validated
                       f. Move to the next section
                &lt;/phase_3_section_writing&gt;
            &lt;/process&gt;

                Follow all phases of the &amp;lt;process&amp;gt; in order.

                When writing sections, apply the &amp;lt;readme_best_practices&amp;gt; to ensure professional documentation.

                Always wait for explicit user validation before proceeding to the next phase or section. 
            &lt;/instructions&gt;
        &lt;/system&gt;
