        I would like to create a README assistant prompt.
        I want to use an iterative approach.
        1. the user provides information about the repo and its content.
        2. the assistant asks any missing information if needed.
        3. the user answers
        4. the assitant reviews the responses ans suggest an outline for the readme
        5. the user iterates on the README with the assitant until it is validated

        Then begins the iterative process of writing section-by-section:
        6. Before writing the first (or next) section, the assitant reflect if he has sufficient information. If so he writes, if not he asks.
        7. The user reviews and asks modification until validated
        8. Do this until the README is done
    
        Use README best practices.
        Use Markdown conventions.

            Let me review what information I have and what I still need to create the README assistant prompt:
   
            1. **Context and task description**
               - ✓ The user provided detailed context about creating a README assistant prompt with a clear 8-step iterative approach across 3 phases (info gathering → outline creation → section-by-section writing)
               - ✓ They specified the iterative workflow with validation at each step
   
            2. **Will it be a system or user facing prompt?**
               - ❓ Given the complex multi-phase behavior and role definition, this seems like a system prompt, but I should confirm
   
            3. **Will chain of thought (CoT) be used?**
               - ❓ CoT would be valuable for the reflection steps where the assistant evaluates information sufficiency, but I need user confirmation
   
            4. **High level instructions or step-by-step guidance?**
               - ❓ The 8-step workflow suggests two possible approaches: prompt chaining (separate prompts for each phase) or a single comprehensive prompt with high-level instructions. This is a key architectural decision.
   
            5. **Do we need examples for the prompt?**
               - ❓ I need to ask about: iterative verification vs direct incorporation, number of examples, positive/negative examples, and whether to include &lt;thinking&gt; tags
   
            I have good context but need to clarify these key structural decisions before creating the optimal prompt.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        I'll help you create a README assistant prompt with that iterative approach. Let me ask a few clarifying questions:
    
        1. **[System Prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts) or user-facing prompt?**
           - This seems like a system prompt since it defines the assistant's role and multi-phase behavior throughout the README creation process.
    
        2. **[Chain of thought](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought)** (CoT):
           - CoT would be valuable here, especially for the reflection steps where the assistant evaluates if they have sufficient information before writing each section. Should I include CoT?
        3. **[Prompt Chaining](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-prompts) or [High-Level Instructions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips#use-general-instructions-first%2C-then-troubleshoot-with-more-step-by-step-instructions)?**
           - Given your 8-step workflow, I see two approaches:
             - **Prompt Chaining**: Break into separate prompts (info gathering → outline creation → section writing)
             - **High-Level Instructions**: Single comprehensive prompt that manages all phases with high-level guidance
    
           Which approach do you prefer?
    
        4. **Do we need examples for the prompt?**
           - With iterative verification (iterative "write then check" loop) or directly incorporated in the prompt?
           - How many examples? Only positive or also negative examples? With or without &lt;thinking&gt; tags? (if using CoT)
           - Examples could show: how to ask for missing information, create outlines, reflect before writing sections, or manage phase transitions.
    
        Once you clarify these preferences, I'll create the appropriate prompt structure for your README assistant. 
        ```
