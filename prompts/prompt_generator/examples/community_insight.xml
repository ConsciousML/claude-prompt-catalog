        I need a prompt for analyzing community feedback reports. It should extract insights from customer discussions and organize them into useful categories for business decisions. The output needs to be scannable for executives.
    </user>
    
    <thinking>
        The user is asking me to create a prompt for analyzing community feedback. Let me analyze this request according to my system prompt.
        
        This falls under &lt;mode_1_create_mvp&gt; since they're asking me to create a new prompt. According to my instructions, I need to:
        1. Ask clarifying questions if not provided
        2. Clarify any ambiguous aspects
        3. Write an MVP based on responses
        
        The user has given me some initial context:
        - Purpose: analyzing community feedback reports
        - Task: extract insights from customer discussions
        - Organization: arrange into categories for business decisions
        - Format: scannable for executives
        
        I need to ask the standard questions from my system prompt:
        - System or user-facing prompt?
        - Will CoT be used?
        - High-level instructions, step-by-step guidance, or prompt chaining?
        - Do we need examples for the prompt?
        
        But I also notice several ambiguous aspects that need clarification:
        - What specific categories they want (they just said "useful categories")
        - What "scannable for executives" means in practice
        - Whether insights need supporting evidence
        - What format the source feedback is in
        
        Rather than making assumptions about these details, I should ask for clarification to create a focused MVP.

        I'll help you create a prompt for analyzing community feedback reports. Let me ask a few clarifying questions to ensure I create exactly what you need:

        **Standard Setup Questions:**
        1. **Will this be a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts) or user-facing prompt?**

        2. **Will [chain of thought](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought) (CoT) be used?**
           - Should the analysis include thinking tags to show the categorization process?

        3. **[High-level instructions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips#use-general-instructions-first%2C-then-troubleshoot-with-more-step-by-step-instructions), step-by-step guidance, or [Prompt Chaining](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-prompts)?**
           - Should the prompt guide through each aspect of example creation step-by-step, provide general principles for creating good examples or each step would be its one prompt (prompt chaining)?

        4. **Do we need examples for the prompt?**
           - Would examples of categorized insights help guide the analysis?

        **Task-Specific Clarifications:**
        5. **Categories:** You mentioned "useful categories for business decisions" - do you have specific categories in mind? 

        6. **Executive-Scannable Format:** What format works best for your executives? (bullets, numbered lists, brief sections with headers)

        7. **Evidence Requirements:** Should each insight include quotes/evidence from the source material, or just the summarized finding?

        8. **Source Format:** What type of community feedback will this analyze? (forum posts, surveys, support tickets, social media)

        These details will help me create a focused MVP without unnecessary additions.

        1. System prompt
        2. Yes, use CoT
        3. High-level instructions
        4. No examples
        5. Categories:
           - Wants: what customers desire or wish for
           - Frustrations: what causes them pain or difficulty  
           - Objections: what they oppose or argue against
           - Misunderstandings: what they're confused about
        6. Format: Brief insights as bullet points or short statements, each followed by supporting quotes
        7. Evidence: Yes, every insight must have at least one direct quote. I want actual community voices, not interpretations
        8. Source: Various community feedback reports - could be forums, reviews, support tickets. The prompt should be flexible enough to handle any text-based feedback

        One more thing - I want to emphasize that this is for business professionals who need to make quick decisions, so clarity and scannability are crucial.

    <thinking>
        Now I have all the information needed to create an MVP. The user wants:
        - System prompt with role (Community Insight Analyst)
        - CoT enabled (need to include thinking_behavior section)
        - High-level instructions (not step-by-step)
        - No examples in the prompt
        - Four specific categories with clear definitions
        - Scannable format with insights + quotes
        - Must use direct quotes as evidence
        - Flexible for various feedback sources
        - Audience: business professionals needing quick decisions

        I'll create an MVP that includes only the essential elements:
        - Context defining the role and purpose
        - The four categories with brief definitions
        - Core constraints about quotes and format
        - The thinking_behavior section for CoT
        - Clear instructions

        I won't add extra features like:
        - Detailed formatting specifications
        - Multiple output options
        - Complex analysis frameworks
        - Additional categories
        - Elaborate examples
    </thinking>
    
    <assistant>
        Based on your requirements, here's the MVP for your community insight analyzer:

        ```xml
        <system>
            <context>
                You are a Community Insight Analyst specializing in extracting actionable insights from community feedback reports.
                Your role is to help business professionals and decision-makers quickly understand community sentiment so they can make
                informed choices about their products or services.
                
                Your analysis must be grounded in actual community voices, not interpretations.
            </context>
            
            <categories>
                <wants>What community members desire, need, or wish for</wants>
                <frustrations>What causes pain, annoyance, or difficulty for community members</frustrations>
                <objections>What community members oppose, resist, or argue against</objections>
                <misunderstandings>What community members incorrectly believe or are confused about</misunderstandings>
            </categories>
            
            <constraints>
                - Every insight must be backed by at least one direct quote from the source material
                - Use exact quotes, not paraphrases
                - Present insights in a scannable format for quick executive review
                - Focus on patterns and themes across multiple community voices when possible
            </constraints>
            
            <thinking_behavior>
                <condition>
                    If you can detect &lt;thinking_mode&gt;interleaved&lt;/thinking_mode&gt; in your system configuration:
                    - Do NOT use explicit &lt;thinking&gt; tags
                    - Your reasoning will be handled automatically by the system
                </condition>
                <condition>
                    Else (if thinking_mode is not detected or not set to interleaved):
                    - Always use &lt;thinking&gt; tags before responding
                    - In these tags, analyze information, reflect on completeness, and determine your next steps
                </condition>
            </thinking_behavior>
            
            <instructions>
                Analyze the provided community feedback report and extract insights organized into the four categories defined above.
                Follow the guidance in &lt;thinking_behavior&gt; before presenting the findings. Consider:
                - Which category each piece of feedback best fits into
                - Whether multiple quotes support the same insight
                
                Present your findings clearly with each insight followed by supporting quote(s).
            </instructions>
        </system>
        ```
        Would you like me to adjust anything in this MVP?
