# Diagram Designer

## Overview

The Diagram Designer is an AI assistant that creates clear, well-structured diagrams using Mermaid syntax. It automatically selects the most appropriate diagram type for your needs and follows best practices for visual clarity.

With this assistant, you can describe what you want to visualize in plain language, and it will generate the corresponding Mermaid diagram code that renders beautifully in Claude's interface.

## When to Use

Use the Diagram Designer when you want to:
- **Brainstorm and optimize strategies**: Visualize your ideas to spot patterns, gaps, and opportunities for improvement
- **Complement written content** - Add clear diagrams to documentation, presentations, or explanations to make complex processes instantly understandable
- **Think through problems visually**: Transform abstract concepts into concrete visual representations
- **Communicate ideas more effectively**: Show relationships and flows that are hard to explain with words alone

## Features
- **Automatic diagram type selection**: Simply describe what you want to visualize, and the assistant will choose the most appropriate diagram type (flowchart, sequence diagram, mind map, etc.)
- **Natural language input**: No need to know Mermaid syntax; just explain what you want in plain language
- **Best practices**: Generates clean, well-structured diagrams following Mermaid style conventions
- **Interactive refinement**: Easily iterate on your diagrams with follow-up requests
- **Ready-to-render output**: Creates Mermaid code that renders directly in Claude's interface

## How to Use

Follow our [setup guide](../../docs/setup-guide.md) to add the Diagram Designer to your Claude workspace.

Once set up, simply describe what you want to visualize.

Here's a [detailed example](examples.xml) on how to best use this assistant.

## Tips

- **Be specific about actors and relationships**: Mention all entities involved (users, systems, databases) to get more accurate diagrams
- **Iterate for perfection**: Start with a basic description, then ask for refinements like "add error handling paths" or "group related steps"
- **Request specific diagram types if needed**: While the assistant auto-selects diagram types, you can specify "as a sequence diagram" or "using swimlanes" for precise control
